const stickyInput4 = "i came across a design challenge pretty quickly into the project. the **'raised footer'** issue. pages which had little or no content meant a footer which failed to stay grounded to the bottom of the page. it was time to add the **Flexbox 'sticky footer'** solution developed by **philip walton**. suggestions on **github** that"

const stickyInput7 = "i also found that **react developers** seem to have a hard time translating traditional implementations of **flexbox** to **React DOM** configurations. i had that problem at first as well. but then i started examining the ***structure*** of my **React** application from the React point of view, and things became clear pretty quickly."
